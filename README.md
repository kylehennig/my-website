# Kyle Hennig's website

This is the repository for the home page of my personal website, https://www.kylehennig.com.

The entire website is written from scratch using HTML and Sass (a style sheet language that compiles to CSS). No server-side code is necessary.

## Getting started
To generate the CSS stylesheet, you will first need to install Sass, which is available as an npm package. Run `npm -g install sass` in a terminal to install it. The version of Sass used for this project is 1.14.0, though most other versions should work just fine.

## Running the project
Run `make` to generate the necessary files to run the website.
If you would like to autoregenerate the CSS files as you edit, run `make watch`. This will monitor all your Sass files for changes and update the CSS according.
To remove any autogenerated files, run `make clean`.

To quickly view the website, you can simply open index.html in your web browser of choice. However, for development you should run a static web server to ensure all of the intended functionality works.

If you have Python 3 installed, it's as simple as running `python3 -m http.server` in this directory.
Afterward, navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view the website.
